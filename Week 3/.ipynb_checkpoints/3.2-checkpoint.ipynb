    "## 1. Understanding Errors and Exceptions\n",
    "In Python, errors that occur during the execution of a program are called exceptions. When an exception occurs, the program normally stops (\"crashes\") and prints an error message (a \"traceback\"). Learning to anticipate and handle these exceptions is key to writing reliable code.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different types of errors:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Syntax Errors**: Errors in the structure of your code (e.g., missing colon, misspelled keyword). These are caught before the program even starts running.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example of a SyntaxError\n",
    "# if True\n",
    "#     print(\"Hello\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "* **Runtime Errors (Exceptions)**: Errors that occur while the program is running (e.g., trying to divide by zero, accessing a non-existent file, trying to convert text to a number). These are the ones we can \"handle.\""

    "### 3.4. Working with CSV Files using the `csv` Module\n",
    "\n",
    "For more robust and reliable handling of Comma Separated Values (CSV) files, Python's built-in `csv` module is highly recommended. It handles complexities like quoted fields, commas within fields, and different delimiters automatically. While Pandas is excellent for large-scale data, the `csv` module is perfect for simpler CSV operations without external dependencies.\n",

    "To use it, you'll typically import the `csv` module.\n",

    "\n",
    "* **Errors (Exceptions)** are runtime problems that can crash your program.\n",
    "* Use `try-except` blocks to **handle exceptions gracefully**, preventing crashes.\n",
    "* Specific `except` blocks catch particular error types (`ZeroDivisionError`, `ValueError`, `FileNotFoundError`).\n",
    "* The `else` block runs if no exception occurs in `try`.\n",
    "* The `finally` block always runs, useful for cleanup.\n",
    "* **File I/O** involves reading from and writing to files.\n",
    "* Use `open(filename, mode)` to get a file object.\n",
    "* **Always close files** using `file_object.close()` or, preferably, the **`with` statement** for automatic closing.\n",
    "* The `with` statement is the recommended way for file handling.\n",
    "* You can read entire files (`.read()`), read line by line (`.readline()`, or iterate over file object), or read all lines into a list (`.readlines()`).\n",
    "* The **`csv` module** provides a robust way to read and write structured data in CSV format, handling quoting and delimiters automatically."

    "## Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "Complete the following exercises in a new Python script or a new Jupyter Notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Safe Integer Division:**\n",
    "    * Write a function `safe_integer_division(numerator: int, denominator: int) -> int | str:`\n",
    "    * This function should attempt to perform integer division (`//`).\n",
    "    * Use a `try-except` block to catch `ZeroDivisionError`. If caught, return the string \"Error: Division by zero is not allowed.\"\n",
    "    * If no error occurs, return the result of the integer division.\n",
    "    * Test with `safe_integer_division(10, 3)` and `safe_integer_division(7, 0)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **File Reader with Error Handling:**\n",
    "    * Write a function `read_scientific_notes(filename: str) -> list[str] | str:`\n",
    "    * This function should attempt to open and read all lines from the specified `filename`.\n",
    "    * Use a `with` statement for file handling.\n",
    "    * Use a `try-except` block to catch `FileNotFoundError`. If caught, return the string \"Error: Notes file not found at specified path.\"\n",
    "    * If the file is read successfully, return a list of strings, where each string is a line from the file (make sure to `strip()` any leading/trailing whitespace, especially newlines).\n",
    "    * Create a dummy file named `notes.txt` with a few lines of text for testing.\n",
    "    * Test your function with `read_scientific_notes(\"notes.txt\")` and `read_scientific_notes(\"non_existent_notes.txt\")`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Data Logging to File:**\n",
    "    * Write a function `log_experiment_data(exp_id: str, temperature: float, pressure: float, output_filename: str = \"experiment_data.log\") -> None:`\n",
    "    * This function should append a new line to `output_filename` each time it's called.\n",
    "    * The line should be formatted as: `Experiment ID: [exp_id], Temp: [temperature:.1f]C, Pressure: [pressure:.2f]kPa`\n",
    "    * Use the `with` statement in append mode (`\"a\"`).\n",
    "    * Call the function multiple times with different data to simulate logging.\n",
    "        * `log_experiment_data(\"E001\", 23.5, 101.2, \"my_exp_log.txt\")`\n",
    "        * `log_experiment_data(\"E002\", 24.0, 100.9, \"my_exp_log.txt\")`\n",
    "        * `log_experiment_data(\"E003\", 22.8, 101.5, \"my_exp_log.txt\")`\n",
    "    * After running the calls, manually open `my_exp_log.txt` to verify its content.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Process Numerical Data from File:**\n",
    "    * Create a file named `sensor_readings.txt` with the following content:\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "        15.2\n",
    "        16.1\n",
    "        error_value\n",
    "        14.9\n",
    "        17.0\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "    * Write a Python script that reads this file line by line.\n",
    "    * For each line, attempt to convert the line to a `float`.\n",
    "    * Use a `try-except ValueError` block:\n",
    "        * If conversion is successful, add the number to a running total.\n",
    "        * If a `ValueError` occurs (e.g., \"error_value\"), print a message like \"Skipping invalid data: [line_content]\".\n",
    "    * After processing all lines, print the `total_sum` of valid numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  **CSV Data Processor:**\n",
    "    * Create a CSV file named `lab_samples.csv` with the following content (including the header):\n",
    "        ```csv\n",
    "        SampleID,Weight(g),Material\n",
    "        S001,10.5,Quartz\n",
    "        S002,12.1,Feldspar\n",
    "        S003,9.8,Mica\n",
    "        S004,15.0,\"Calcite, with impurities\"\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "    * Write a Python script that uses the `csv` module to read this file.\n",
    "    * Print the header row.\n",
    "    * For each data row, print the `SampleID` and `Weight(g)`. Make sure to convert `Weight(g)` to a float.\n",
    "    * Calculate and print the `average_weight` of all samples.\n",
    "    * *Hint:* You'll need to skip the header row when calculating the average.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.  **Write Processed Data to CSV:**\n",
    "    * You have the following processed data (list of lists):\n",
    "        ```python\n",
    "        processed_data = [\n",
    "            [\"Run_A\", 25.7, \"SUCCESS\"],\n",
    "            [\"Run_B\", 26.1, \"FAILURE\"],\n",
    "            [\"Run_C\", 25.9, \"SUCCESS\"]\n",
    "        ]\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "    * Write this data to a new CSV file named `processed_runs.csv`.\n",
    "    * The header row should be: `[\"RunID\", \"Temperature(C)\", \"Outcome\"]`.\n",
    "    * Use the `csv` module to write the header and then the `processed_data`.\n",
    "    * After writing, read the `processed_runs.csv` file back using the `csv` module and print its contents to verify."
