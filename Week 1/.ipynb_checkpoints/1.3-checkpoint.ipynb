    "\n",
    "Complete the following exercises in a new Python script or a new Jupyter Notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Sum of Measurements:**\n",
    "    * Create a list of daily measurements: `daily_measurements: list[float] = [1.2, 1.5, 1.1, 1.8, 1.3, 1.6, 1.4]`.\n",
    "    * Use a `for` loop to calculate the total sum of these measurements.\n",
    "    * Print the `total_sum`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Countdown Timer:**\n",
    "    * Use a `while` loop to simulate a countdown from 5 down to 1.\n",
    "    * After each number, print a message like \"Counting down: 5\".\n",
    "    * After the loop finishes, print \"Blast off!\".\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Data Filtering with `continue`:**\n",
    "    * You have a list of sensor readings, some of which are invalid (represented by `None` or values below 0):\n",
    "        `sensor_readings: list[float | None] = [10.5, 12.1, None, 9.8, -1.0, 11.2, 13.0]`\n",
    "    * Use a `for` loop. For each reading:\n",
    "        * If the reading is `None` or less than 0, use `continue` to skip it and print \"Skipping invalid reading.\".\n",
    "        * Otherwise, print \"Processing reading: {reading}\".\n",
    "    * *Hint:* You'll need to check for `None` and then for values less than 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Find First Anomaly with `break`:**\n",
    "    * You have a list of temperature readings: `temps: list[float] = [25.0, 25.1, 24.9, 26.5, 25.2, 27.0]`\n",
    "    * An \"anomaly\" is any temperature reading greater than 26.0.\n",
    "    * Use a `for` loop to iterate through the `temps` list.\n",
    "    * If an anomaly is found, print \"Anomaly detected at temperature: {anomaly_temp}\" and then use `break` to stop the loop immediately.\n",
    "    * If the loop completes without finding an anomaly, print \"No anomalies detected.\" (You'll need an `else` block for the `for` loop for this, which executes only if the loop finishes without a `break`).\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  **Grid Coordinate Printer (Nested Loop):**\n",
    "    * Imagine a 3x3 experimental grid.\n",
    "    * Use nested `for` loops to print all possible (row, column) coordinates.\n",
    "    * The output should look like:\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "        (0, 0)\n",
